## Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Changes are grouped by added, fixed or changed feature.

### [3.0.0] - 2019-03-xx
- Bumped version requirement to PHP 7.2.
- Db package is now separated to its own component, Libvaloa-db. Libvaloa will only concentrate on XSL UI and related utilities.
- Remove I18n package completely. There are better translation libs out there, so it doesn't really bring any value to Libvaloa.
- Move all debug classes under Debug package. Effectively: Debug -> Debug\Debug, Debugtimer -> Debug\Debugtimer, Xml\DomDebug -> Debug\DomDebug.

### [2.0.0] - 2018-06-04
#### Added
- Rename Db\Object as Db\Item, this is necessary for PHP 7.2 compatibility (Object is now reserved word).

### [1.3.0] - 2018-03-22
#### Added
- Set and bind in Db\ResultSet now allow PDO type constants to be passed as a parameter.

### [1.2.3] - 2018-03-21
#### Fixed
- Readme fix.

### [1.2.2] - 2018-03-21
#### Fixed
- Gettext now returns original string if translation is not found.

### [1.2.1] - 2018-03-13
#### Fixed
- Gettext was always forced as default translator backend, oops.

### [1.2.0] - 2018-02-27
#### Added
- Gettext translation support, \I18n\Translate\Gettext.
- Composer dependency to Gettext/gettext.

#### Added

- Xml/Xml now uses Xml/Conversion when including view data with addObject. 
- Attributes are now possible from the UI since we use Xml/Conversion
- Updated PHP requirement to 5.6 to simplify maintainance.
- Memory requirements are slightly higher after Xml/Conversion migration.

### [1.0.1] - 2015-05-14
#### Fixed
- Libvaloa\Debug: Debug prints should output only when error level is E_ALL.
